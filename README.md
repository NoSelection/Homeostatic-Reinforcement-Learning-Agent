# Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning Agent 

A biologically-inspired AI system where an agent learns to survive by maintaining internal physiological balance. This project successfully demonstrates **Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning (HRL)** - a cutting-edge research concept that bridges artificial intelligence and neuroscience.

## üèÜ **RESULTS**

After **5 million training steps**, our agent achieved remarkable homeostatic intelligence:

```
Final Training Metrics (5M steps):
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Episode Length: 490+ steps (vs. initial 34 steps) 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Average Reward: +440 (vs. initial -70)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Survival Rate: 40-60% (vs. initial 0%)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Training Time: ~18 minutes on modern hardware
```

**Evaluation Results:**
- **Average Episode Length**: 375.8 steps  
- **Average Reward**: +239.19 ¬± 182.07
- **Survival Rate**: 40% (4/10 episodes reaching max length)
- **Best Episodes**: 500+ steps with rewards up to +521

## üß† What is Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning?

Unlike traditional RL that optimizes external rewards, HRL agents maintain **internal physiological stability**:

### Core Concept
- **Agent has 3 physiological needs**: hunger, thirst, energy
- **Variables decay naturally** over time (biological realism)
- **Reward = maintaining internal balance** (not external goals)
- **Survival emerges** from successful homeostatic regulation

### Why This Matters
- **Biologically plausible** - mimics real organism survival
- **Research-level AI** - rarely implemented concept
- **Emergent intelligence** - complex behavior from simple rules
- **Consciousness connection** - homeostasis theories in AI

## üåç Environment Design

**Easy Homeostatic Grid World** (optimized for learning):
```
Grid Size: 8x8
Resources: 6 food + 6 water + 4 rest areas
Decay Rates: 3-4x slower than biological rates
Starting Position: Center spawn
Resource Density: High (easier learning)
```

**Physiological Variables:**
- **Hunger**: Setpoint 0.5, decays at 0.003/step
- **Thirst**: Setpoint 0.5, decays at 0.004/step  
- **Energy**: Setpoint 0.8, decays at 0.002/step

## üöÄ Quick Start

# Choose option 3 to evaluate the trained agent
```

### 3. Train Your Own Agent

python train_easy_agent.py
# Choose option 2, recommend 1M+ timesteps for good results
```

### 4. Analyze Performance
```bash
python demo.py
# Choose option 4 for detailed analysis and visualizations
```

## üìä Training Journey & Insights

### The Challenge
Homeostatic RL proved **extremely difficult** because agents must master:

1. **Spatial Navigation** - Learning grid world layout
2. **Resource Recognition** - Identifying food/water/rest locations  
3. **Temporal Prediction** - Seeking resources BEFORE critical states
4. **Multi-Objective Balance** - Managing 3 competing physiological needs
5. **Long-term Planning** - Surviving 500+ steps requires foresight

### The Breakthrough
- **Original environment**: Agent died in 34 steps consistently
- **Key insight**: Standard RL hyperparameters insufficient for biological complexity
- **Solution**: "Easy" environment with optimized learning conditions
- **Result**: 5M training steps achieved stable homeostatic behavior

### Training Optimizations Applied
```python
# Slower decay rates (easier survival)
'hunger': {'decay_rate': 0.003},    # vs 0.01 original
'thirst': {'decay_rate': 0.004},    # vs 0.015 original  
'energy': {'decay_rate': 0.002}     # vs 0.008 original

# Enhanced reward shaping
- Homeostatic stability (primary)
- Exploration bonuses (movement rewards)
- Resource proximity rewards (guidance)
- Consumption bonuses (immediate feedback)
- Survival bonuses (staying alive)

# Better observations (agent can see resource distances)
obs_space = [x, y, hunger, thirst, energy, 
            nearest_food_dist, nearest_water_dist, nearest_rest_dist]
```
